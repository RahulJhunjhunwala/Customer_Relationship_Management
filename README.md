# Customer_Relationship_Management

As part of the online course "Spring & Hibernate for Beginners", I have developed a website that allows me to add, update or delete a customer from the database.

I have made use of Java Annotations all over the project.

Technologies used are:
1. Spring MVC
2. Hibernate
3. MySQL database

I have created CustomerController, CustomerService and CustomerDAO to communicate between the different components of the application.

The communication is as follows:

Browser <--> View <--> Controller <--> Service <--> Data Access Object <--> MySQL Database
